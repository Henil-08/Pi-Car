# Pi-Car
“Self-driving cars are the natural extension of active safety and obviously something we should do.” ~Elon Musk. In this world of Autonomous Cars, I have made a simple yet innovative Autonomous RC Car that uses very minimal and less costly Hardware and simple computer vision to Detect Green Lane Lines and drive bounded to them. Here's a Quick Look for my Car which I Coded, Assembled from scratch.
