# Pi-Car
“Self-driving cars are the natural extension of active safety and obviously something we should do.” ~Elon Musk. In this world of Autonomous Cars, I have made a simple yet innovative Autonomous RC Car that uses very minimal and less costly Hardware and simple computer vision to Detect Green Lane Lines and drive bounded to them. 

## To Get Started you'll need:
1. Basic Knowledge of Python Programming Language 
2. Basic Knowledge of OpenCV Library
3. How to use and Handle Raspberry Pi
4. Some Mechanical Skills 
5. Most Importantly, Courage to handle Failure

## Hardware Requirements for the Project:
1. Raspberry Pi 4 ModelB (Any Ram Version)
2. Arduino Uno (Any Arduino Board)
3. L298N Motor Driver
4. Any RC Car of your choice
